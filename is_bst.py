# input format:
#### The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The vertices of the tree are numbered from 0 to 𝑛 − 1. Vertex 0 is the root.
#### The next 𝑛 lines contain information about vertices 0, 1, ..., 𝑛−1 in order. Each of these lines contains
#### three integers 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 — 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 is the key of the 𝑖-th vertex, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 is the index of the left
#### child of the 𝑖-th vertex, and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 is the index of the right child of the 𝑖-th vertex. If 𝑖 doesn’t have
#### left or right child (or both), the corresponding 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 or 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 (or both) will be equal to −1.
# output format:
#### Output Format. If the given binary tree is a correct binary search tree,
#### output one word “CORRECT” (without quotes). Otherwise, output one word “INCORRECT” (without quotes).
